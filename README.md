# Picbook 🖼📕 :  Adding life to moments.

## About
Picbook is an application that let's you store the most precious moments of your life in the clouds, miles away from getting deleted(by  mistake, ofcourse!)

## Stacks
- React , in the frontend.
- Firebase , in the backend as the service.

**Introduction**
- This is a relatively easy and a fun way to getting started with hands on application with cloud services and integrating them with the view.
- Seamless full stack experience , without the hassles of creating your own server, controllers or data model.
- Why not? Becuase Firebase takes care of all those for us. It is a quite popular backend as a service platform, and experience w/ firebase gives you a competetive edge.

*Note* : A Prior understanding of React is necessary to move forward, with this one.
