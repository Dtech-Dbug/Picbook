## About

Picbook is an application that let's you store the most precious moments of your life in the clouds, miles away from getting deleted(by  mistake, ofcourse!)

## Stacks
- React , in the frontend.
- Firebase , in the backend as the service.

**Introduction**
- This is a relatively easy and a fun way to getting started with hands on application with cloud services and integrating them with the view.
- Seamless full stack experience , without the hassles of creating your own server, controllers or data model.
- Why not? Becuase Firebase takes care of all those for us. It is a quite popular backend as a service platform, and experience w/ firebase gives you a competetive edge, in the cloud-driven tech space. ‚òÅ

*Note* : A Prior understanding of React is necessary to move forward, with this one.

### 2. Getting started w/ picbook codebase
***Project Dependancies***
- create-react-app : *CRA template to auto generate a react codebase* 
- firebase : *to be able to use firebase services* ``` npm i firebase ```
- framer-motion : *for adding quirk and fun animation* ``` npm i framer-motion ```
- Docs  : [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) , [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) , [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

***Services used from firebase***
- Firestore : *Like a database to store all the urls of the uploaded images. üî•*
- Storage : *to store the uploaded images and get their URLS before adding the images to the firestore collection üí•*

***Initialising firebase services, after configuring firebase config with the sdk from firebase***


*Importing services we would use*
- ``` import firebase from 'firebase' ```
- ```import 'firebase/storage' ```
- ``` import firebase/firestore' ```


*Intiliasing the services*
- ``` let projectStorage(any name) = firebase.storage() ```
-  ``` let projectFirestore = firebase.firestore() ```
-  ``` export { projectStorage , projectFirestore} ``` : to be able to use the services, we need to export the variables which stores the invoked/initialised services
